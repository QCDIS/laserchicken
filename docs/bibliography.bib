                   north of 50° is exceptionally flat; slopes and
                   surface roughness increase toward the equator. The
                   polar layered terrain appears to be a thick ice-rich
                   formation with a non-equilibrium planform indicative
                   of ablation near the periphery. Slope relations
                   suggest that the northern Tharsis province was
                   uplifted in the past. A profile across Ares Vallis
                   channel suggests that the discharge through the

                   requiring high reliability in the 3D measurements,
                   point clouds are proposed as basis for the 3D Digital
                   digital earth representation. For the development of
                   DEAs, we propose to follow a workflow with four
                   components: data acquisition and processing, data
                   management, data analysis and data visualization. For

  abstract =      {Modeling real-world trees is important in many
                   application areas, including computer graphics,
                   botany and forestry. An example of a modeling method
                   is reconstruction from light detection and ranging
                   (LiDAR) scans. In contrast to terrestrial LiDAR
                   systems, airborne LiDAR systems – even current
                   high-resolution systems – capture only very few
                   samples on tree branches, which makes the
                   reconstruction of trees from airborne LiDAR a
                   challenging task. In this paper, we present a new
                   method to model plausible trees with fine details
                   from airborne LiDAR point clouds. To reconstruct tree
                   models, first, we use a normalized cut method to
                   segment an individual tree point cloud. Then, trunk
                   points are added to supplement the incomplete point
                   cloud, and a connected graph is constructed by
                   searching sufficient nearest neighbors for each
                   point. Based on the observation of real-world trees,
                   a direction field is created to restrict branch
                   directions. Then, branch skeletons are constructed
                   using a bottom-up greedy algorithm with a priority
                   queue, and leaves are arranged according to
                   phyllotaxis. We demonstrate our method on a variety
                   of examples and show that it can generate a plausible
                   tree model in less than one second, in addition to
                   preserving features of the original point cloud.},

                   LIDAR is a remote sensing method which ‘maps’
                   surfaces by shining light at them and measuring how
                   long the light takes to return. Within horticulture,
                   it’s main use has been in estimating canopy volume

                   fertilizer distribution. In this review, André
                   Colaço at the University of São Paulo in Brazil and
                   colleagues describe the evolution of this technology
                   and its broader applications. They suggest that by
                   combining LIDAR with other information, such as soil
                   electrical conductivity and fertility; or historic
                   yield, disease and pest occurrence, growers could
                   fine-tune crop production. LIDAR could also be used
                   to evaluate the performance of new plant varieties.},

  abstract =      {Aim: Vegetation structure is a key determinant of
                   animal diversity and species distributions. The
                   introduction of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
                   has enabled the collection of massive amounts of
                   point cloud data for quantifying habitat structure at
                   fine resolution. Here, we review the current use of
                   LiDAR-derived vegetation metrics in diversity and
                   distribution research of birds, a key group for
                   understanding animal–habitat relationships.
                   Location: Global. Methods: We review 50 relevant
                   papers and quantify where, in which habitats, at
                   which spatial scales and with what kind of LiDAR data
                   current studies make use of LiDAR metrics. We also
                   harmonize and categorize LiDAR metrics and quantify
                   their current use and effectiveness. Results: Most
                   studies have been conducted at local extents in
                   temperate forests of North America and Europe.
                   Rasterization is currently the main method to derive
                   LiDAR metrics, usually from airborne laser scanning
                   data with low point densities (<10 points/m²) and
                   small footprints (<1 m diameter). Our metric
                   harmonization suggests that 40% of the currently used
                   metric names are redundant. A categorization scheme
                   allowed to group all metric names into 18 out of 24
                   theoretically possible classes, defined by vegetation
                   part (total vegetation, single trees, canopy,
                   understorey, and other single layers as well as
                   multi-layer) and structural type (cover, height,
                   horizontal variability and vertical variability).
                   Metrics related to canopy cover, canopy height and
                   canopy vertical variability are currently most often
                   used, but not always effective. Main conclusions:
                   Light Detection and Ranging metrics play an important
                   role in understanding animal space use. Our review
                   and the developed categorization scheme may
                   facilitate future studies in the selection,
                   prioritization and ecological interpretation of LiDAR
                   metrics. The increasing availability of airborne and
                   spaceborne LiDAR data and the development of
                   voxel-based and object-based approaches will further
                   allow novel ecological applications, also for open
                   habitats and other vertebrate and invertebrate taxa.},

                   using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology
                   to characterize the vertical and horizontal

                   birds in forests and marshlands, for insect
                   pollinators in agricultural landscapes, and songbirds
                   at stopover sites during migration. This will allow
                   novel insights into the hierarchical structure of
                   animal-habitat associations, into why animal
                   populations decline, and how they respond to habitat

                   annotation/segmentation, object classification, and
                   evaluation), and a PostGIS spatial database. The

  abstract =      {Essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) have been
                   proposed by the Group on Earth Observations
                   Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) to
                   identify a minimum set of essential measurements that
                   are required for studying, monitoring and reporting
                   biodiversity and ecosystem change. Despite the
                   initial conceptualisation, however, the practical
                   implementation of EBVs remains challenging. There is
                   much discussion about the concept and implementation
                   of EBVs: which variables are meaningful; which data
                   are needed and available; at which spatial, temporal
                   and topical scales can EBVs be calculated; and how
                   sensitive are EBVs to variations in underlying data?
                   To advance scientific progress in implementing EBVs
                   we propose that both scientists and research
                   infrastructure operators need to cooperate globally
                   to serve and process the essential large datasets for
                   calculating EBVs. We introduce GLOBIS-B (GLOBal
                   Infrastructures for Supporting Biodiversity
                   research), a global cooperation funded by the Horizon
                   2020 research and innovation framework programme of
                   the European Commission. The main aim of GLOBIS-B is
                   to bring together biodiversity scientists, global
                   research infrastructure operators and legal
                   interoperability experts to identify the research
                   needs and infrastructure services underpinning the
                   concept of EBVs. The project will facilitate the
                   multi-lateral cooperation of biodiversity research
                   infrastructures worldwide and identify the required
                   primary data, analysis tools, methodologies and legal
                   and technical bottlenecks to develop an agenda for
                   research and infrastructure development to compute
                   EBVs. This requires development of standards,
                   protocols and workflows that are
                   ‘self-documenting’ and openly shared to allow the
                   discovery and analysis of data across large spatial
                   extents and different temporal resolutions. The
                   interoperability of existing biodiversity research
                   infrastructures will be crucial for integrating the
                   necessary biodiversity data to calculate EBVs, and to
                   advance our ability to assess progress towards the
                   Aichi targets for 2020 of the Convention on
                   Biological Diversity (CBD).},

abstract = "There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.",

                   low density (average 1 pulse/m2) full-waveform (FWF)
                   airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for individual
                   tree detection and tree species classification and
                   compared the results to the ones obtained using
                   discrete return laser scanning. The aim is to
                   approach a low-cost, fully ALS-based operative forest
                   inventory method that is capable of providing
                   species-specific diameter distributions required for
                   wood procurement. The point data derived from
                   waveform data were used for individual tree detection
                   (ITD). Features extracted from segmented tree objects
                   were used in random forest classification by which
                   both feature selection and classification were
                   performed. Experiments were conducted with 5532
                   ground measured trees from 292 sample plots and using
                   FWF data collected with Leica ALS60 scanner over a
                   boreal forest, mainly consisting of pine, spruce and
                   birch, in southern Finland. For the comparisons,
                   system produced multi-echo discrete laser data (DSC)
                   were also analyzed with the same procedures. The
                   detection rate of individual trees was slightly
                   higher using FWF point data than DSC point data.
                   Overall detection accuracy, however, was similar
                   because commission error was increased when omission
                   error was decreasing. The best overall classification
                   accuracy was 73.4% which contains an 11 percentage
                   points increase when FWF features were included in
                   the classification compared with DSC features alone.
                   The results suggest that FWF ALS data contains more
                   information about the structure and physical
                   properties of the environment that can be used in
                   tree species classification of pine, spruce and birch
                   when comparing with DSC ALS data.},

                   and intensity analysis is introduced and validated.
                   After a preliminary analysis to avoid the trivial
                   classification of homogeneous datasets, a
                   non-parametric estimation of the probability density
                   function is computed for both elevation and intensity
                   data values. Some statistical tests are used for
                   selecting the category of data (elevation or
                   intensity) that better satisfies a bi- or a
                   multi-modal distribution. The iterative analysis of
                   skewness and kurtosis is then applied to this
                   category to obtain a first classification. At each
                   step, the point with the highest value of elevation
                   (or intensity) is removed. The classification is then
                   refined by studying both statistical moments of the
                   complementary data category, in order to look for
                   potential sub-clusters. Remaining clusters are
                   identified by applying the same iterative procedure
                   to the still unclassified LiDAR points. For more
                   complex point distribution shapes or for the
                   classification of large scenes, a progressive
                   analysis is proposed, which is based on the
                   partitioning of the entire dataset into more
                   sub-sets. Each of them is then independently
                   classified by using the core procedure. Some
                   numerical experiments on real LiDAR data confirmed
                   the potentiality of the filtering/classification

                   ecosystem services. Aerial photogrammetry and
                   hyperspectral imaging are the usual data acquisition
                   methods but the application of airborne laser
                   scanning (ALS) as a standalone tool also holds
                   promises for this field since it can be used to
                   quantify 3-dimensional vegetation structure. Lake
                   Balaton is a large shallow lake in western Hungary
                   with shore wetlands that have been in decline since
                   the 1970s. In August 2010, an ALS survey of the
                   shores of Lake Balaton was completed with 1 pt/m2
                   discrete echo recording. The resulting ALS dataset
                   was processed to several output rasters describing
                   vegetation and terrain properties, creating a
                   sufficient number of independent variables for each
                   raster cell to allow for basic multivariate
                   classification. An expert-generated decision tree
                   algorithm was applied to outline wetland areas, and
                   within these, patches dominated by Typha sp. Carex
                   sp., and Phragmites australis. Reed health was mapped
                   into four categories: healthy, stressed, ruderal and
                   die-back. The output map was tested against a set of
                   775 geo-tagged ground photographs and had a user’s
                   accuracy of > 97% for detecting non-wetland features
                   (trees, artificial surfaces and low density Scirpus
                   stands), > 72% for dominant genus detection and > 80%
                   for most reed health categories (with 62% for one
                   category). Overall classification accuracy was 82.5%,
                   Cohen’s Kappa 0.80, which is similar to some
                   hyperspectral or multispectral-ALS fusion studies.
                   Compared to hyperspectral imaging, the processing
                   chain of ALS can be automated in a similar way but
                   relies directly on differences in vegetation
                   structure and actively sensed reflectance and is thus
                   probably more robust. The data acquisition parameters
                   are similar to the national surveys of several
                   European countries, suggesting that these existing
                   datasets could be used for vegetation mapping and
                   monitoring.},

                   derived by means of a small-footprint laser scanner
                   over young and mature forest stands using regression
                   analysis. The sample plots were distributed
                   systematically throughout a 1000-ha study area, and
                   the size of each plot was 200 m2. On the average, the
                   distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 m
                   on the ground. The plots were divided into three
                   strata according to age class and site quality. The
                   stratum-specific regressions explained 82–95%,

                   two-stage procedure for prediction of corresponding
                   characteristics of entire forest stands was tested.
                   Sixty-one stands within the study area, with an
                   average size of 1.6 ha each, were divided into 200 m2
                   regular grid cells. The six examined characteristics
                   were predicted for each grid cell from the
                   corresponding laser data utilizing the estimated
                   regression equations. Average values for each stand
                   was computed. Most stand level predictions were

                   determination of city models for visualization
                   purposes, several standardized workflows do exist.
                   They are either based on photogrammetry or on LiDAR
                   or on a combination of both data acquisition
                   techniques. However, the automated determination of
                   reliable and highly accurate city models is still a
                   challenging task, requiring a workflow comprising
                   several processing steps. The most relevant are
                   building detection, building outline generation,
                   building modeling, and finally, building quality
                   analysis. Commercial software tools for building
                   modeling require, generally, a high degree of human
                   interaction and most automated approaches described
                   in literature stress the steps of such a workflow
                   individually. In this article, we propose a
                   comprehensive approach for automated determination of
                   3D city models from airborne acquired point cloud
                   data. It is based on the assumption that individual
                   buildings can be modeled properly by a composition of
                   a set of planar faces. Hence, it is based on a
                   reliable 3D segmentation algorithm, detecting planar
                   faces in a point cloud. This segmentation is of
                   crucial importance for the outline detection and for
                   the modeling approach. We describe the theoretical
                   background, the segmentation algorithm, the outline
                   detection, and the modeling approach, and we present
                   and discuss several actual projects.},

                   become dissected or degraded with time, but still
                   retain original features related to their
                   geologic-geomorphic origin. To decipher the
                   information hidden in the relief, recognition of such
                   features is required, possibly in an automated
                   manner. In our study, using Shuttle Radar Topography
                   Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), an
                   existing algorithm has been adapted to recognize
                   quasi-planar features fulfilling specified criteria.
                   The method has been applied to a study area of the
                   Central Andes with Miocene to Quaternary volcanic
                   edifices, tilted ignimbrite surfaces, and
                   basin-filling sediments. The result is a surface
                   segmentation, whereas non-planar features (gullies,
                   tectonic faults, etc.) are sorted out. The main types
                   of geomorphic features that can be distinguished and
                   interpreted are as follows. (1) The west-dipping
                   western margin of the Altiplano is differentiated
                   into segments of the lower sedimentary cover that of
                   increased erosion by tectonic steepening at
                   intermediate levels, and an upper plane with limited
                   erosion. (2) In the central part of the Western
                   Cordillera, the Oxaya ignimbrite block shows a
                   ‘striped’ bulging pattern that results from a
                   smoothly changing surface dip. This pattern is due to
                   continuous folding/warping of the ignimbrite block
                   possibly related to gravitational movements. (3) To
                   the west, large, uniform planes correspond to flat,
                   smooth, tectonically undisturbed surfaces of young
                   sedimentary cover of the Central Basin. (4) The
                   evolution of Taapaca volcanoes with sector collapse
                   events and cone-building phases is shown by several
                   segments with overlapping clastic aprons. (5) To the
                   east, on the western margin of the Altiplano, young
                   intermontane basins filled by Upper Miocene sediments
                   show progressively increasing dip toward basin
                   margins, reflected by a circular pattern of the
                   segmentation planes. We show that the segmentation
                   models provide meaningful images and additional
                   information for geomorphometric analysis that can be
                   interpreted in terms of geological and surface
                   evolution models. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \&

title = "Identification of linear vegetation elements in a rural landscape using LiDAR point clouds",
abstract = "Modernization of agricultural land use across Europe is responsible for a substantial decline of linear vegetation elements such as tree lines, hedgerows, riparian vegetation, and green lanes. These linear objects have an important function for biodiversity, e.g., as ecological corridors and local habitats for many animal and plant species. Knowledge on their spatial distribution is therefore essential to support conservation strategies and regional planning in rural landscapes but detailed inventories of such linear objects are often lacking. Here, we propose a method to detect linear vegetation elements in agricultural landscapes using classification and segmentation of high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point data. To quantify the 3D structure of vegetation, we applied point cloud analysis to identify point-based and neighborhood-based features. As a preprocessing step, we removed planar surfaces such as grassland, bare soil, and water bodies from the point cloud using a feature that describes to what extent the points are scattered in the local neighborhood. We then applied a random forest classifier to separate the remaining points into vegetation and other. Subsequently, a rectangularity-based region growing algorithm allowed to segment the vegetation points into 2D rectangular objects, which were then classified into linear objects based on their elongatedness. We evaluated the accuracy of the linear objects against a manually delineated validation set. The results showed high user's (0.80), producer's (0.85), and total accuracies (0.90). These findings are a promising step towards testing our method in other regions and for upscaling it to broad spatial extents. This would allow producing detailed inventories of linear vegetation elements at regional and continental scales in support of biodiversity conservation and regional planning in agricultural and other rural landscapes.",

                   first archaeological application of airborne LiDAR
                   survey to historic-era landscapes in the Caribbean
                   archipelago, on the island of Montserrat. LiDAR is
                   proving invaluable in extending the reach of
                   traditional pedestrian survey into less favorable
                   areas, such as those covered by dense neotropical
                   forest and by ashfall from the past two decades of
                   active eruptions by the Soufrière Hills volcano, and
                   to sites in localities that are inaccessible on
                   account of volcanic dangers. Emphasis is placed on
                   two aspects of the research: first, the importance of
                   ongoing, real-time interaction between the LiDAR
                   analyst and the archaeological team in the field; and
                   second, the advantages of exploiting the full
                   potential of the three-dimensional LiDAR point cloud
                   data for purposes of the visualization of
                   archaeological sites and features.},

                   survey into archaeological research and cultural
                   heritage management has substantially added to our
                   knowledge of archaeological remains in forested
                   areas, and is changing our understanding of how these
                   landscapes functioned in the past. Further, the
                   results of ALS-based surveys of woodlands can now
                   potentially be incorporated into micro-regional and
                   landscape scale studies which rely on survey data,
                   making an important contribution to our understanding
                   of settlement patterns and land use – but doing so
                   requires us to recognize and manage a host of biases
                   inherent in ALS-based survey data. While many types
                   of archaeological remains manifest as
                   micro-topography, several important classes of
                   features commonly appear as standing remains. The
                   identification of these remains is important for
                   archaeological prospection surveys based on ALS data.
                   Standing structures in mixed scenes with vegetation
                   are not well addressed by standard classification
                   approaches. In this paper we propose an approach to
                   the identification of these structures in the point
                   cloud based on multi-scale measures of roughness, and
                   measures of local density and normal orientation. We
                   demonstrate this approach using discrete-return ALS
                   data collected in the Franche-Comté region of
                   France.},
